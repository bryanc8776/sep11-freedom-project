### 9/30/24:
* [p5play:Learn](https://p5play.org/learn/index.html)
* [p5play-Docs](https://p5play.org/docs/index.html)
* [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

### 10/20/24:
* [p5play: Sprites](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html)
  * [Basic Properties](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=0)
    * Read through the examples
    * Changed values of `sprite.basic-property = value` which changed things like x/y position, width, height, color, diameter, rotation, and text-size.
    * Did level 0 challenge which asked to create a blue circle and place it in the top right corner of the canvas
  * [Physics](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=1)
    * Learned about `.collider` which detecs collisions of a sprite with other sprites.
    * `.collider` types are `s`(static), `k`(kinematic), `n`(none), and the default `d`(dynamic)
    * also learned about `world.gravity`
  * [Movement](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=3)
    * learned about different movements and properties that affect/cause the movement
    * `velocity`, `direction`, `speed`, `move`, `moveTo`, `moveTowards`
  * Continued through the rest of the lessons on `Sprites` and changed lines of code to see what it did and what it changed in the example and challenges.
* I went through the [Group](https://p5play.org/learn/group.html), [Animation](https://p5play.org/learn/animation.html), [Input](https://p5play.org/learn/input.html), [Camera](https://p5play.org/learn/camera.html), [Joints](https://p5play.org/learn/joints.html), [Canvas](https://p5play.org/learn/canvas.html), and [World](https://p5play.org/learn/world.html) sections.
* I plan on making a mini project using the properties I learned and watch videos on p5play.

### 10/27/24:
* Watched these three videos on p5play
  * [Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5addy2G5DIc&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=1)
  * [Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPTrLLdCX-Y&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=2)
  * [Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vk5HlcFA8&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=3)
  * Helped me review the things I learned in the docs of p5play and get a better understanding of what I need to have in order to make p5play run in my own website.
* [This](https://jsbin.com/qudinafaso/edit?js,output) is my mini project.
  * It is pretty simple
  * Includes things like `collision`, `color`, `stroke`, `velocity`, and `kb.pressing`.
* I plan on making this project a little more advanced or make a new project and include different properties.

### 11/4/24:
* I worked on adding more elements to my mini project on [here](https://jsbin.com/nayekaheyu/edit?js,output).
  * I added a little "goal-like" area
  * Made the canvas bigger
  * Added a new block/player
  * I need to try to fix the movement when pressing a key (so it only moves 1 player instead of both)
