* [p5.js Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)

### 10/20/24:
* [p5play: Sprites](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html)
  * [Basic Properties](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=0)
    * Read through the examples
    * Changed values of `sprite.basic-property = value` which changed things like x/y position, width, height, color, diameter, rotation, and text-size.
    * Did level 0 challenge which asked to create a blue circle and place it in the top right corner of the canvas
  * [Physics](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=1)
    * Learned about `.collider` which detecs collisions of a sprite with other sprites.
    * `.collider` types are `s`(static), `k`(kinematic), `n`(none), and the default `d`(dynamic)
    * also learned about `world.gravity`
  * [Movement](https://p5play.org/learn/sprite.html?page=3)
    * learned about different movements and properties that affect/cause the movement
    * `velocity`, `direction`, `speed`, `move`, `moveTo`, `moveTowards`
  * Continued through the rest of the lessons on `Sprites` and changed lines of code to see what it did and what it changed in the example and challenges.
