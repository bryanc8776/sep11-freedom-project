# Entry 4: Learning Continued
##### 3/10/25

### Content
Over the past weeks, I have been trying to work on my MVP for my game, which is the minimum I need to make it work. To understand how much I need to make a functional soccer game and keep track of my progress, I made a [plan](../prep/plan.md). I have made some progress towards my MVP, but still need to learn and make a lot.

This is what I have done so far. I set the borders and the field lines to 'white' with `field.color` and `border.color`, added goals/nets for each player, added a scoreboard which tells the time and score, and made the time increase. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on steps 2 and 3 of the EDP. I am working on my MVP, but still need to learn more about the code of p5play to make my game work and be more interactive/advanced. I also need to continue following my plan and make some changes so I can make sure I finish my MVP.

### Skills
The skills I have improved on are **Communication** and **Collaboration**. In the past week, I had to do a project in APUSH with a group and the DOM Challenge in SEP with my partner. In APUSH, I had to talk with my partners, making sure we all knew what we were doing and preparing to present to our classmates. In my presentation, I felt that I did a good job, trying to give as much details as I could remember. In SEP, I had to make sure my partner and I were communicating through Slack and in class to prevent merge conflicts.
