### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on steps 2 and 3 of the EDP. I am working on my MVP, but still need to learn more about the code of p5play to make my game work and be more interactive/advanced. 

### Skills
The skills I have improved on are **Communication** and **Collaboration**. In the past week, I had to do a project in APUSH with a group and the DOM Challenge in SEP with my partner. In APUSH, I had to talk with my partners, making sure we all knew what we were doing and preparing to present to our classmates. In my presentation, I felt that I did a good job, trying to give as much details as I could remember. In SEP, I had to make sure my partner and I were communicating through Slack and in class to prevent merge conflicts.
