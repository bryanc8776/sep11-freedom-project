# Entry 1: Choosing a Tool & Project
##### 10/28/24

### Tool and Project
For the *SEP11 Freedom Project*, I chose to learn [***p5play***](https://p5play.org/). I chose ***p5play*** because it seemed pretty simple and easy to understand, but also included a variety of properties you can add to `sprites` which intrigued me. A backup tool I had was [two.js](https://two.js.org/) which was pretty similar to ***p5play*** but I felt more confident with ***p5play***. My project idea is to make a soccer game that can potentially have most of the features of a real soccer match like a scoreboard, goal, field, time/extra time, and others, as well as be a multiplayer game.

#### Tinkering
Throughout my process of learning ***p5play***, I watched some videos and did some coding. The main videos I watched that really helped me learn how to use ***p5play*** are about "[Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5addy2G5DIc&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=1)", "[Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPTrLLdCX-Y&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=2)", and "[Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vk5HlcFA8&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=3)" from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5addy2G5DIc&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE) tutorial series. Another way I tinkered with ***p5play*** so far is by going through the [*learn sections*](https://p5play.org/learn/index.html). These sections explained the different properties available in ***p5play*** and had coding challenges which I did. They were a little confusing at first but after I reviewed the concepts, I understood what I needed to do. Most of the things I learned about ***p5play*** so far are recorded in my [learning log](../tool/learning-log.md). After watching those videos and going through most of the properties in ***p5play***, I did a [mini project](https://jsbin.com/qudinafaso/edit?js,output) on *jsbin*. It was a pretty simple project which basically creates a 'border' around the 'block' and 'ball' `sprites` using properties like `collision`, `color`, `stroke`, `diameter`, `rotation`, and `velocity` in the `x` and `y` direction.
