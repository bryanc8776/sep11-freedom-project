# Entry 1: Choosing a Tool & Project
##### 10/28/24

### Tool and Project
For the *SEP11 Freedom Project*, I chose to learn [***p5play***](https://p5play.org/). I chose ***p5play*** because it seemed pretty simple and easy to understand, but included a variety of properties you can add to `sprites`. 

#### Tinkering
Throughout my process of learning ***p5play***, I watched some videos and did some coding. The main videos I watched that really helped me learn how to use ***p5play*** are about "[Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5addy2G5DIc&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=1)", "[Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPTrLLdCX-Y&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=2)", and "[Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0vk5HlcFA8&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE&index=3)" from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5addy2G5DIc&list=PLoHS9P-kC-252Pd9MJD_ItfaVuYV2kTCE) tutorial series. Another way I tinkered with ***p5play*** so far is by going through the [documents](https://p5play.org/docs/index.html). These documents explained the different properties available in ***p5play*** and had coding challenges which I did. They were a little confusing at first but after I reviewed the concepts, I understood what I needed to do.
