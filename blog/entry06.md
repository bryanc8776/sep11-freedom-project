# Entry 6: Presentations
##### 5/27/25

### Product
After working on my soccer game for a long time, it was finally time to finish working and convey the result. To do this, we had to present our products in an Expo and in-class presentations, For the in-class presentation, we made [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1joYAra_u6bc89wVVNky22jwCCu56UoHuJmAOU4vMUjc/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) to sum up our entire process as we made our projects. For the Expo, I made a [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sHzAXLp1beL6LjAmeWIu2fQZYAtFTcEKnAVhHP1VFZI/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) to show a little information about my project. [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e1Q1XNOkAAItXt8awBe8Lx2EEA93n6dRRm6pq7gxU5Q/edit?tab=t.0) are my notes that I took as we learned content for sep11.

### Takeaways
#### Expo Elevator Pitch
* It is important to get straight to the point/give a short but detailed description of your project.
* Getting the visitors engaged with a greeting/hook helps the presentation go smoother.
* Showing a demo of your game and explaining the features is important because it makes it easier to understand the function and the purpose.

#### In-class presentation
* A hook(e.g. fact, question, etc.) and greeting is important to get the audience engaged and interested.
* Having images of what you are trying to explain is better than having a lot of words because it helps the audience be more engaged and understand a little more.
* It is important to explain and show your process and include challenges and how you solved those challenges because it shows your dedication and perseverance.
* Ending with a "Thank You" is important to express appreciation to the audience for listening and tell them that you are done.

### Engineering Design Process
After I completed step 7 of the EDP which was to improve my project as needed, which I did by fixing little issues that I had like determining when the game should end, I moved on to step 8. In step 8 I had to communicate the results which was done in the Expo and in-class presentations. In the Expo, we showed our projects to the judges and other visitors while for the in-class presentation we presented our project with slides to our class and Mr. Mueller.

### Skills
The skills I have improved on are **Communication** and **Organization**. For the in-class presentation, I had to organize my content into slides to show my progress as the year went on and how my project went. I decided to start with a hook, then explain the tool I used, show mini-projects I made to tinker, then show and explain the build-up to my soccer game. After that, I moved on to explain my challenges and how I solved it and ended with the takeaways and a "Thank You". I feel that I have greatly improved in **Communication** since last year. When I did the Expo Elevator Pitch, I felt more confident and ready to get the judges interested in my game. Also, for the in-class presentation, I felt way more confident than last year and did better. I made more eye-contact with the audience, spoke louder, and explained many things better.
