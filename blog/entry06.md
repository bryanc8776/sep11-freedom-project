# Entry 6: Presentations
##### 5/27/25

### Takeaways
#### Expo Elevator Pitch
* It is important to get straight to the point/give a short but detailed description of your project.
* Getting the visitors engaged with a greeting/hook helps the presentation go smoother.
* Showing a demo of your game and explaining the features is important because it makes it easier to understand the function and the purpose.

#### In-class presentation
* A hook(e.g. fact, question, etc.) and greeting is important to get the audience engaged and interested.
* Having images of what you are trying to explain is better than having a lot of words because it helps the audience be more engaged and understand a little more.
* It is important to explain and show your process and include challenges and how you solved those challenges because it shows your dedication and perseverance.
* Ending with a "Thank You" is important to express appreciation to the audience for listening and tell them that you are done.
