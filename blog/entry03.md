### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on steps 2 and 3 of the EDP. I am still learning more about the concepts in my tool and trying out different things. At the same time, I am trying to make the possible MVP of my project but I am struggling to incorporate certain necessary elements like a score and timer.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on is **Attention to Detail**. While working on my FP goal, I had to make sure I spelled all the variable/sprite names correctly and the properties as well otherwise the code wouldn't run. Since I was really careful, I had very little syntax errors which were easy to correct. Also when I was doing other tasks like the ELA Regents, I had to read the question and text carefully to answer the question correctly.

Another skill I have improved on is **Problem decomposition**. When we were doing the *Algorithms Log*, I felt like it was a lot of work. I decided to first try to write the code to complete the task. Then I would comment what each piece of code does and later put it into my repo. After all that, I would write my progress and process in the google sheet. Though it seemed like a lot, it felt way easier once I broke it down into separate sections instead of going back and forth between tabs.
