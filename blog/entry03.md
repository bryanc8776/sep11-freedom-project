# Entry 3: Learning p5play 
##### 2/3/25

### Content
Over the Winter Break, I continued to learning and use my tool but I did not fully complete my Winter Break goal which was to add most of the features of a soccer game to my project. [This](https://jsbin.com/kigahihipu/edit?js,output) project is how far I got over the break. It is not how much I wanted to get done or as complex as I wanted it to be.

It just contains things such as'field', two players ("player1" moves with "WASD" and "player2" moves with "Arrowkeys"), and a "ball" which is the smaller circle.

After break, I kept on adding to my [project](https://jsbin.com/pobipetuya/edit?js,output). I added a score for player1(score1) and player2(score2) which increases when the ball's position is inside the "field goal" lines at the opposite vertical "border" ends. I also tried to add a timer which I still need to understand how it works. 

#### Next Steps
I plan on completing my FP goal in the next weeks with this project. I need to add a limit to the scores and make them appear on the game rather than the console. I also need to change the timer to increase, add a limit, and make it bigger to see. Another thing I plan on doing is making it so when " " is pressed and a player collides with the ball, the ball will move away towards the direction of the force and with a velocity based on the force applied. For the score top increase, I need to add code so that when the ball crosses the "net" it will give the player a goal. 

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on steps 2 and 3 of the EDP. I am still learning more about the concepts in my tool and trying out different things. At the same time, I am trying to make the possible MVP of my project but I am struggling to incorporate certain necessary elements like a score and timer.

### Skills
A skill I have improved on is **Attention to Detail**. While working on my FP goal, I had to make sure I spelled all the variable/sprite names correctly and the properties as well otherwise the code wouldn't run. Since I was really careful, I had very little syntax errors which were easy to correct. Also when I was doing other tasks like the ELA Regents, I had to read the question and text carefully to answer the question correctly.

Another skill I have improved on is **Problem decomposition**. When we were doing the *Algorithms Log*, I felt like it was a lot of work. I decided to first try to write the code to complete the task. Then I would comment what each piece of code does and later put it into my repo. After all that, I would write my progress and process in the google sheet. Though it seemed like a lot, it felt way easier once I broke it down into separate sections instead of going back and forth between tabs.
