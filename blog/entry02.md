# Entry 2: Learning p5play
##### 12/9/24

### Tool Learning
For the past weeks, I have been learning more about my tool, ***p5play***. I have made a lot of progress in understanding and trying out different features of ***p5play***. The main way I have been tinkering is through mini-projects, watching videos, and reviewing the documentations.

### Engineering Design Process
I am currently on stage 2 of the engineering designing process. I am learning about the different code and concepts in ***p5play*** and documenting what I find. After understanding some of the concepts, I try out different code to make mini-projects and get a better sense of how that concept affects the overall project.
