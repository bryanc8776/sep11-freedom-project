# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Bryan Castro**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **p5play** in order to help me make my **soccer game**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* Environment - It is online so it would use less materials to play and advertise.
* Relationships - Can help build friendships since it is a two-player game and they can have fun.
* Individual - Can inspire some to pursure a goal of becoming a soccer player or learn to code so they can make their own games.
##### CONS
* Culture - Might lead to longer use of electronic devices (computers, phones) and less learning.
* Finance - Can potentially lead to other game companies losing money since my game is free.
* Jobs - My game doesn't provide jobs or help facilitate them.
