## Timeline

#### MVP

- [ ] Make a fixed soccer field with boundaries the ball can't go through (deadline: 2/17)
- [ ] Create a scoreboard with a timer next to it (deadline: 2/25)
  - [ ] make the score appear on the game and only when there is a "goal" 
  - [ ] add a limit to the timer and scores: when either is reached, the game will end unless the game is tied
- [ ] Make is so when the ball and player collide and the player presses "space" there is a force on the ball (deadline: 2/30)
  - [ ] The ball goes in the direction of the collision

#### Beyond MVP
