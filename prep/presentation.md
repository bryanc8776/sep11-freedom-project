# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Did you know that over 250 million people across the world play soccer and over 3 billion watch it?

## Product
* Show picture and demo the game
* Explain the controls

## Process
* Show other mini-projects I made + link to p5play
* Show different stages of my project
* Show and explain use of conditionals/functions
* Maybe show difference between MVP and beyond MVP
* Include some challenges (with timer, score, resetting the game)

## Conclusion
* Link to project
* Takeaways: Time management is vital, it is important to spend time on your tool
* Would you be interested in exploring p5play?

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
